# Project features
* ## Customized Course Recommendations:
  * Implement an intelligent course recommendation system based on the student's background, interests, and previous course selections. When students log in or create an account, they can provide information about their academic goals and current knowledge level. The system can then suggest relevant courses for them to consider. For example, if a student has just completed "Introduction to C Programming," the system might recommend "Basic Data Structures" or "Introduction to Algorithms" as logical next steps. This personalized approach can enhance the student's learning experience and encourage them to explore related courses.
  
* ##  Course Management Dashboard:
  * Create a comprehensive dashboard for course administrators and instructors. This dashboard should allow them to manage course information, including adding new courses, setting class schedules, updating course details, and monitoring enrollment. Incorporate data visualization tools to provide insights into course popularity, enrollment trends, and student feedback to help administrators make informed decisions.
    
* ## Course Material Access Control:
  * Ensure that only enrolled students have access to course materials such as lecture notes, videos, assignments, and quizzes. Implement robust access control mechanisms that prevent unauthorized access. For example, students should be able to access course materials only after enrolling and making necessary payments. This feature helps protect your intellectual property and ensures that students who are paying for the courses get the value they expect
