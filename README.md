# Project features
* ## Customized Course Recommendations:
  * Implement an intelligent course recommendation system based on the student's background, interests, and previous course selections. When students log in or create an account, they can provide information about their academic goals and current knowledge level. The system can then suggest relevant courses for them to consider. For example, if a student has just completed "Introduction to C Programming," the system might recommend "Basic Data Structures" or "Introduction to Algorithms" as logical next steps. This personalized approach can enhance the student's learning experience and encourage them to explore related courses.
  
* ##  Course Management Dashboard:
  *Create a comprehensive dashboard for course administrators and instructors. This dashboard should allow them to manage course information, including adding new courses, setting class schedules, updating course details, and monitoring enrollment. Incorporate data visualization tools to provide insights into course popularity, enrollment trends, and student feedback to help administrators make informed decisions.
